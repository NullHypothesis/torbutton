  <title>Introduction</title>
  <para>

This document describes the goals, operation, and testing procedures of the
Torbutton Firefox extension. It is current as of Torbutton 1.2.0rc5.

  </para>
  <sect2 id="adversary">
   <title>Adversary Model</title>
   <para>

A Tor web browser adversary has a number of goals, capabilities, and attack
types that can be used to guide us towards a set of requirements for the
Torbutton extension. Let's start with the goals.

   </para>
   <sect3>
    <title>Adversary Goals</title>
    <orderedlist>
<!-- These aren't really commands.. But it's the closest I could find in an
acceptable style.. Don't really want to make my own stylesheet -->
     <listitem><command>Bypassing proxy settings</command>
     <para>The adversary's primary goal is direct compromise and bypass of 
Tor, causing the user to directly connect to an IP of the adversary's
choosing.</para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem><command>Correlation of Tor vs Non-Tor Activity</command>
     <para>If direct proxy bypass is not possible, the adversary will likely
happily settle for the ability to correlate something a user did via Tor with
their non-Tor activity. This can be done with cookies, cache identifiers,
javascript events, and even CSS. Sometimes the fact that a user uses Tor may
be enough for some authorities.</para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem><command>History disclosure</command>
     <para>
The adversary may also be interested in history disclosure: the ability to
query a user's history to see if they have issued certain censored search
queries, or visited censored sites.
     </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem><command>Location information</command>
     <para>

Location information such as timezone and locality can be useful for the
adversary to determine if a user is in fact originating from one of the
regions they are attempting to control, or to zero-in on the geographical
location of a particular dissident or whistleblower.

     </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem><command>Miscellaneous anonymity set reduction</command>
     <para>

Anonymity set reduction is also useful in attempting to zero in on a
particular individual. If the dissident or whistleblower is using a rare build
of Firefox for an obscure operating system, this can be very useful
information for tracking them down, or at least <link
linkend="fingerprinting">tracking their activities</link>.

     </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem><command>History records and other on-disk
information</command>
     <para>
In some cases, the adversary may opt for a heavy-handed approach, such as
seizing the computers of all Tor users in an area (especially after narrowing
the field by the above two pieces of information). History records and cache
data are the primary goals here.
     </para>
     </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
   </sect3>

   <sect3>
    <title>Adversary Capabilities - Positioning</title>
    <para>
The adversary can position themselves at a number of different locations in
order to execute their attacks.
    </para>
    <orderedlist>
     <listitem><command>Exit Node or Upstream Router</command>
     <para>
The adversary can run exit nodes, or alternatively, they may control routers
upstream of exit nodes. Both of these scenarios have been observed in the
wild.
     </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem><command>Adservers and/or Malicious Websites</command>
     <para>
The adversary can also run websites, or more likely, they can contract out
ad space from a number of different adservers and inject content that way. For
some users, the adversary may be the adservers themselves. It is not
inconceivable that adservers may try to subvert or reduce a user's anonymity 
through Tor for marketing purposes.
     </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem><command>Local Network/ISP/Upstream Router</command>
     <para>
The adversary can also inject malicious content at the user's upstream router
when they have Tor disabled, in an attempt to correlate their Tor and Non-Tor
activity.
     </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem><command>Physical Access</command>
     <para>
Some users face adversaries with intermittent or constant physical access.
Users in Internet cafes, for example, face such a threat. In addition, in
countries where simply using tools like Tor is illegal, users may face
confiscation of their computer equipment for excessive Tor usage or just
general suspicion.
     </para>
     </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
   </sect3>

   <sect3>
    <title>Adversary Capabilities - Attacks</title>
    <para>
The adversary can perform the following attacks from a number of different 
positions to accomplish various aspects of their goals.
    </para>
    <orderedlist>
     <listitem><command>Inserting Javascript</command>
     <para>
Javascript allows the adversary the opportunity to accomplish a number of
their goals. If not properly disabled, Javascript event handlers and timers
can cause the browser to perform network activity after Tor has been disabled,
thus allowing the adversary to correlate Tor and Non-Tor activity. Javascript
also allows the adversary to execute <ulink
url="http://gemal.dk/browserspy/css.html">history disclosure attacks</ulink>:
to query the history via the different attributes of 'visited' links. Finally,
Javascript can be used to query the user's timezone via the
<function>Date()</function> object, and to reduce the anonymity set by querying
the <function>navigator</function> object for operating system, CPU, and user
agent information.
     </para>
     </listitem>

     <listitem><command>Inserting Plugins</command>
     <para>

Plugins are abysmal at obeying the proxy settings of the browser. Every plugin
capable of performing network activity that the author has
investigated is also capable of performing network activity independent of
browser proxy settings - and often independent of its own proxy settings.
In addition, plugins can be used to store unique identifiers that are more
difficult to clear than standard cookies. 
<ulink url="http://epic.org/privacy/cookies/flash.html">Flash-based
cookies</ulink> fall into this category, but there are likely numerous other
examples.

     </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem><command>Inserting CSS</command>
     <para>

CSS can also be used to correlate Tor and Non-Tor activity, via the usage of
<ulink url="http://www.tjkdesign.com/articles/css%20pop%20ups/">CSS
popups</ulink> - essentially CSS-based event handlers that fetch content via
CSS's onmouseover attribute. If these popups are allowed to perform network
activity in a different Tor state than they were loaded in, they can easily
correlate Tor and Non-Tor activity and reveal a user's IP address. In
addition, CSS can also be used without Javascript to perform <ulink
url="http://ha.ckers.org/weird/CSS-history.cgi">CSS-only history disclosure
attacks</ulink>.
     </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem><command>Read and insert cookies</command>
     <para>

An adversary in a position to perform MITM content alteration can inject
document content elements to both read and inject cookies for
arbitrary domains. In fact, many "SSL secured" websites are vulnerable to this
sort of <ulink url="http://seclists.org/bugtraq/2007/Aug/0070.html">active
sidejacking</ulink>.

     </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem><command>Create arbitrary cached content</command>
     <para>

Likewise, the browser cache can also be used to <ulink
url="http://crypto.stanford.edu/sameorigin/safecachetest.html">store unique
identifiers</ulink>. Since by default the cache has no same-origin policy,
these identifiers can be read by any domain, making them an ideal target for
adserver-class adversaries.

     </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem id="fingerprinting"><command>Fingerprint users based on browser
attributes</command>
<para>

There is an absurd amount of information available to websites via attributes
of the browser. This information can be used to reduce anonymity set, or even
<ulink url="http://0x000000.com/index.php?i=520&amp;bin=1000001000">uniquely
fingerprint individual users</ulink>. </para>
<para>
For illustration, let's perform a
back-of-the-envelope calculation on the number of anonymity sets for just the
resolution information available in the <ulink
url="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/DOM:window">window</ulink> and
<ulink
url="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/DOM:window.screen">window.screen</ulink>
objects. Browser window resolution information provides something like
(1280-640)*(1024-480)=348160 different anonymity sets. Desktop resolution
information contributes about another factor of 5 (for about 5 resolutions in
typical use). In addition, the dimensions and position of the desktop taskbar
are available, which can reveal hints on OS information. This boosts the count
by a factor of 5 (for each of the major desktop taskbars - Windows, OSX, KDE
and Gnome, and None). Subtracting the browser content window
size from the browser outer window size provide yet more information.
Firefox toolbar presence gives about a factor of 8 (3 toolbars on/off give
2<superscript>3</superscript>=8). Interface effects such as titlebar fontsize
and window manager settings gives a factor of about 9 (say 3 common font sizes
for the titlebar and 3 common sizes for browser GUI element fonts).
Multiply this all out, and you have (1280-640)*(1024-480)*5*5*8*9 ~=
2<superscript>29</superscript>, or a 29 bit identifier based on resolution
information alone. </para>

<para>

Of course, this space is non-uniform and prone to incremental changes.
However, if a bit vector space consisting of the above extracted attributes
were used instead of the hash approach from <ulink
url="http://0x000000.com/index.php?i=520&amp;bin=1000001000">The Hacker
Webzine article above</ulink>, minor changes in browser window resolution will
no longer generate totally new identifiers. 

</para>
<para>

To add insult to injury, <ulink
url="http://pseudo-flaw.net/content/tor/torbutton/">chrome URL disclosure
attacks</ulink> mean that each and every extension on <ulink
url="https://addons.mozilla.org">addons.mozilla.org</ulink> adds another bit
to that 2<superscript>29</superscript>. With hundreds of popular extensions
and thousands of extensions total, it is easy to see that this sort of
information is an impressively powerful identifier if used properly by a
competent and determined adversary such as an ad network.  Again, a
nearest-neighbor bit vector space approach here would also gracefully handle
incremental changes to installed extensions.

</para>

     </listitem>
     <listitem><command>Remotely or locally exploit browser and/or
OS</command>
     <para>
Last, but definitely not least, the adversary can exploit either general 
browser vulnerabilities, plugin vulnerabilities, or OS vulnerabilities to
install malware and surveillance software. An adversary with physical access
can perform similar actions. Regrettably, this last attack capability is
outside of Torbutton's ability to defend against, but it is worth mentioning
for completeness.

  <sect2 id="requirements">
   <title>Torbutton Requirements</title>
<note>

Since many settings satisfy multiple requirements, this design document is
organized primarily by Torbutton components and settings. However, if you are
the type that would rather read the document from the requirements
perspective, it is in fact possible to search for each of the following
requirement phrases in the text to find the relevant features that help meet
that requirement.

</note>
   <para>

From the above Adversary Model, a number of requirements become clear.

   <title>Extension Layout</title>

<para>Firefox extensions consist of two main categories of code: 'Components' and
'Chrome'. Components are a fancy name for classes that implement a given
interface or interfaces. In Firefox, components <ulink
url="http://www.xulplanet.com/references/xpcomref/creatingcomps.html">can be
written</ulink> in C++,
Javascript, or a mixture of both. Components have two identifiers: their
'<ulink
url="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/xpcom/book/cxc/html/quicktour2.html#1005005">Contract
ID</ulink>' (a human readable path-like string), and their '<ulink
url="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/xpcom/book/cxc/html/quicktour2.html#1005329">Class
ID</ulink>' (a GUID hex-string). In addition, the interfaces they implement each have a hex
'Interface ID'. It is possible to 'hook' system components - to reimplement
their interface members with your own wrappers - but only if the rest of the
browser refers to the component by its Contract ID. If the browser refers to
the component by Class ID, it bypasses your hooks in that use case.
Technically, it may be possible to hook Class IDs by unregistering the
original component, and then re-registering your own, but this relies on
obsolete and deprecated interfaces and has proved to be less than
stable.</para>

<para>'Chrome' is a combination of XML and Javascript used to describe a window.
Extensions are allowed to create 'overlays' that are 'bound' to existing XML
window definitions, or they can create their own windows. The DTD for this XML
is called <ulink
url="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/XUL_Reference">XUL</ulink>.</para>
  </sect2>
</sect1>
<sect1>
  <title>Components</title>
  <para>

Torbutton installs components for two purposes: hooking existing components to
reimplement their interfaces; and creating new components that provide
services to other pieces of the extension.
 
  </para>

  <sect2>
   <title>Hooked Components</title>

<para>Torbutton makes extensive use of Contract ID hooking, and implements some
of its own standalone components as well.  Let's discuss the hooked components
first.</para>

<sect3 id="sessionstore">
 <title><ulink
url="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/nsISessionStore">@mozilla.org/browser/sessionstore;1</ulink> -
<ulink
url="https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/torbutton/trunk/src/components/nsSessionStore2.js">components/nsSessionStore2.js</ulink>
and <ulink
url="https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/torbutton/trunk/src/components/nsSessionStore3.js">components/nsSessionStore3.js</ulink></title>

<para>These components address the <link linkend="disk">Disk Avoidance</link>
requirements of Torbutton. As stated in the requirements, Torbutton needs to
prevent Tor tabs from being written to disk by the Firefox session store for a
number of reasons, primary among them is the fact that Firefox can crash at
any time, and a restart can cause you to fetch tabs in the incorrect Tor
state.</para>

<para>These components illustrate a complication with Firefox hooking: you can
only hook member functions of a class if they are published in an
interface that the class implements. Unfortunately, the sessionstore has no
published interface that is amenable to disabling the writing out of Tor tabs
in specific. As such, Torbutton had to include the <emphasis>entire</emphasis>
nsSessionStore from both Firefox 2 and Firefox 3, 
with a couple of modifications to prevent tabs that were loaded with Tor
enabled from being written to disk, and some version detection code to
determine which component to load. The <ulink
url="https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/torbutton/trunk/src/components/nsSessionStore3.diff">diff against the original session
store</ulink> is included in the SVN repository.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3>
<title><ulink
url="http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/browser/components/sessionstore/src/nsSessionStartup.js">@mozilla.org/browser/sessionstartup;1</ulink> -
    <ulink
url="https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/torbutton/trunk/src/components/crash-observer.js">components/crash-observer.js</ulink></title>

<para>This component wraps the Firefox Session Startup component that is in
charge of <ulink
url="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Session_store_API">restoring saved
sessions</ulink>. The wrapper's only job is to intercept the
<function>doRestore()</function> function, which is called by Firefox if it is determined that the
browser crashed and the session needs to be restored. The wrapper notifies the
Torbutton chrome that the browser crashed by setting the pref
<command>extensions.torbutton.crashed</command>, or that it is a normal
startup via the pref <command>extensions.torbutton.noncrashed</command>. The Torbutton Chrome <ulink
url="http://www.xulplanet.com/references/xpcomref/ifaces/nsIPrefBranch2.html#method_addObserver">listens for a
preference change</ulink> for this value and then does the appropriate cleanup. This
includes setting the Tor state to the one the user selected for crash recovery
in the preferences window (<command>extensions.torbutton.restore_tor</command>), and
restoring cookies for the corresponding cookie jar, if it exists.</para>

<para>By performing this notification, this component assists in the 
<link linkend="proxy">Proxy Obedience</link>, and <link
linkend="isolation">Network Isolation</link> requirements.
</para>


</sect3>
<sect3>
<title><ulink
url="http://www.xulplanet.com/references/xpcomref/comps/c_browserglobalhistory2.html">@mozilla.org/browser/global-history;2</ulink>
- <ulink
  url="https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/torbutton/trunk/src/components/ignore-history.js">components/ignore-history.js</ulink></title>

<para>This component was contributed by <ulink
url="http://www.collinjackson.com/">Collin Jackson</ulink> as a method for defeating
CSS and Javascript-based methods of history disclosure. The global-history
component is what is used by Firefox to determine if a link was visited or not
(to apply the appropriate style to the link). By hooking the <ulink
url="http://www.xulplanet.com/references/xpcomref/ifaces/nsIGlobalHistory2.html#method_isVisited">isVisited</ulink>
and <ulink 
url="http://www.xulplanet.com/references/xpcomref/ifaces/nsIGlobalHistory2.html#method_addURI">addURI</ulink>
methods, Torbutton is able to selectively prevent history items from being
added or being displayed as visited, depending on the Tor state and the user's
preferences.
</para>
<para>
This component helps satisfy the <link linkend="state">State Separation</link>
and <link linkend="disk">Disk Avoidance</link> requirements of Torbutton.
</para>
</sect3>
</sect2>
<sect2>
<title>New Components</title>

<para>Torbutton creates four new components that are used throughout the
extension. These components do not hook any interfaces, nor are they used
anywhere besides Torbutton itself.</para>

<sect3>
<title><ulink
url="https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/torbutton/trunk/src/components/cookie-jar-selector.js">@stanford.edu/cookie-jar-selector;2
- components/cookie-jar-selector.js</ulink></title>

<para>The cookie jar selector (also based on code from <ulink
url="http://www.collinjackson.com/">Collin
Jackson</ulink>) is used by the Torbutton chrome to switch between
Tor and Non-Tor cookies. Its operations are simple: sync cookies to disk, then
move the current cookies.txt file to the appropriate backup location
(cookies-tor.txt or cookies-nontor.txt), and then moving the other cookie jar
into place.</para>

<para>
This component helps to address the <link linkend="state">State
Isolation</link> requirement of Torbutton.

<title><ulink
url="https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/torbutton/trunk/src/components/torbutton-logger.js">@torproject.org/torbutton-logger;1
- components/torbutton-logger.js</ulink></title>

<para>The torbutton logger component allows on-the-fly redirection of torbutton
logging messages to either Firefox stderr
(<command>extensions.torbutton.logmethod=0</command>), the Javascript error console
(<command>extensions.torbutton.logmethod=1</command>), or the DebugLogger extension (if
available - <command>extensions.torbutton.logmethod=2</command>). It also allows you to
change the loglevel on the fly by changing
<command>extensions.torbutton.loglevel</command> (1-5, 1 is most verbose).
</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="windowmapper">

<title><ulink
url="https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/torbutton/trunk/src/components/window-mapper.js">@torproject.org/content-window-mapper;1
- components/window-mapper.js</ulink></title>

<para>Torbutton tags Firefox <ulink
url="http://www.xulplanet.com/references/elemref/ref_tabbrowser.html">tabs</ulink> with a special variable that indicates the Tor
state the tab was most recently used under to fetch a page. The problem is
that for many Firefox events, it is not possible to determine the tab that is
actually receiving the event. The Torbutton window mapper allows the Torbutton
chrome and other components to look up a <ulink
url="http://www.xulplanet.com/references/elemref/ref_tabbrowser.html">browser
tab</ulink> for a given <ulink
url="http://www.xulplanet.com/references/xpcomref/ifaces/nsIDOMWindow.html">HTML content
window</ulink>. It does this by traversing all windows and all browsers, until it
finds the browser with the requested <ulink
url="http://www.xulplanet.com/references/elemref/ref_browser.html#prop_contentWindow">contentWindow</ulink> element. Since the content policy
and page loading in general can generate hundreds of these lookups, this
result is cached inside the component.
</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="contentpolicy">
<title><ulink
url="https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/torbutton/trunk/src/components/cssblocker.js">@torproject.org/cssblocker;1
- components/cssblocker.js</ulink></title>

<para>This is a key component to Torbutton's security measures. When Tor is
toggled, Javascript is disabled, and pages are instructed to stop loading.
However, CSS is still able to perform network operations by loading styles for
onmouseover events and other operations. In addition, favicons can still be
loaded by the browser. The cssblocker component prevents this by implementing
and registering an <ulink
url="http://www.xulplanet.com/references/xpcomref/ifaces/nsIContentPolicy.html">nsIContentPolicy</ulink>.
When an nsIContentPolicy is registered, Firefox checks every attempted network
request against its <ulink
url="http://www.xulplanet.com/references/xpcomref/ifaces/nsIContentPolicy.html#method_shouldLoad">shouldLoad</ulink>
member function to determine if the load should proceed. In Torbutton's case,
the content policy looks up the appropriate browser tab using the <link
linkend="windowmapper">window mapper</link>,
and checks that tab's load tag against the current Tor state. If the tab was
loaded in a different state than the current state, the fetch is denied.
Otherwise, it is allowed.</para> This helps to achieve the <link
linkend="isolation">Network
Isolation</link> requirements of Torbutton.

<para>In addition, the content policy also blocks website javascript from
<ulink url="http://pseudo-flaw.net/content/tor/torbutton/">querying for
versions and existence of extension chrome</ulink> while Tor is enabled, and
also masks the presence of Torbutton to website javascript while Tor is
disabled. </para>

<para>

Finally, some of the work that logically belongs to the content policy is
instead handled by the <command>torbutton_http_observer</command> and
<command>torbutton_weblistener</command> in <ulink
url="https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/torbutton/trunk/src/chrome/content/torbutton.js">torbutton.js</ulink>. These two objects handle blocking of
Firefox 3 favicon loads, popups, and full page plugins, which for whatever
reason are not passed to the Firefox content policy itself (see Firefox Bugs 
<ulink
url="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=437014">437014</ulink> and 
<ulink
url="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=401296">401296</ulink>).

The browser overlay helps to satisfy a number of Torbutton requirements. These
are better enumerated in each of the Torbutton preferences below. However,
there are also a number of Firefox preferences set in
<function>torbutton_update_status()</function> that aren't governed by any
Torbutton setting. These are:
</para>
<orderedlist>

 <listitem><ulink
url="http://kb.mozillazine.org/Browser.bookmarks.livemark_refresh_seconds">browser.bookmarks.livemark_refresh_seconds</ulink>
<para>
This pref is set in an attempt to disable the fetching of LiveBookmarks via
Tor. Since users can potentially collect a large amount of live bookmarks to
very personal sites (blogs of friends, wikipedia articles they maintain,
comment feeds of their own blog), it is not possible to cleanly isolate these
fetches and they are simply disabled during Tor usage.
This helps to address the <link

Unfortunately <ulink

reads from <command>extensions.torbutton.banned_ports</command>) to the list
of ports Firefox is forbidden to access. These ports are Polipo, Privoxy, Tor,
and the Tor control port, respectively. This is set for both Tor and Non-Tor
usage, and prevents websites from attempting to do http fetches from these
ports to see if they are open, which addresses the <link

 <title>Toggle Code Path</title>
 <para>

The act of toggling is connected to <function>torbutton_toggle()</function>
via the <ulink
url="https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/torbutton/trunk/src/chrome/content/torbutton.xul">torbutton.xul</ulink>
and <ulink
url="https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/torbutton/trunk/src/chrome/content/popup.xul">popup.xul</ulink>
overlay files. Most of the work in the toggling process is present in <ulink
url="https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/torbutton/trunk/src/chrome/content/torbutton.js">torbutton.js</ulink> 

</para>
<para>

Toggling is a 3 stage process: Button Click, Proxy Update, and
Settings Update. These stages are reflected in the prefs
<command>extensions.torbutton.tor_enabled</command>,
<command>extensions.torbutton.proxies_applied</command>, and
<command>extensions.torbutton.settings_applied</command>. The reason for the
three stage preference update is to ensure immediate enforcement of <link
linkend="isolation">Network Isolation</link> via the <link
linkend="contentpolicy">content policy</link>. Since the content window
javascript runs on a different thread than the chrome javascript, it is
important to properly convey the stages to the content policy to avoid race
conditions and leakage, especially with <ulink
url="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=409737">Firefox Bug 
409737</ulink> unfixed. The content policy does not allow any network activity
whatsoever during this three stage transition.

 </para>
 <sect2>
  <title>Button Click</title>
  <para>

This is the first step in the toggling process. When the user clicks the
toggle button or the toolbar, <function>torbutton_toggle()</function> is
called. This function checks the current Tor status by comparing the current
proxy settings to the selected Tor settings, and then sets the proxy settings
to the opposite state, and sets the pref
<command>extensions.torbutton.tor_enabled</command> to reflect the new state.
It is this proxy pref update that gives notification via the <ulink
url="http://www.xulplanet.com/references/xpcomref/ifaces/nsIPrefBranch2.html#method_addObserver">pref
observer</ulink>
<command>torbutton_unique_pref_observer</command> to perform the rest of the
toggle.

  </para>
 </sect2>
 <sect2>
  <title>Proxy Update</title>
  <para>

When Torbutton receives any proxy change notifications via its
<command>torbutton_unique_pref_observer</command>, it calls
<function>torbutton_set_status()</function> which checks against the Tor
settings to see if the Tor proxy settings match the current settings. If so,
it calls <function>torbutton_update_status()</function>, which determines if
the Tor state has actually changed, and sets
<command>extensions.torbutton.proxies_applied</command> to the appropriate Tor
state value, and ensures that
<command>extensions.torbutton.tor_enabled</command> is also set to the correct
value. This is decoupled from the button click functionalty via the pref
observer so that other addons (such as SwitchProxy) can switch the proxy
settings between multiple proxies.

  </para>
 </sect2>
 <sect2>
  <title>Settings Update</title>
  <para>

The next stage is also handled by
<function>torbutton_update_status()</function>. This function sets scores of
Firefox preferences, saving the original values to prefs under
<command>extensions.torbutton.saved.*</command>, and performs the history
clearing, cookie jaring, and ssl certificate jaring work of Torbutton. At the
end of its work, it sets
<command>extensions.torbutton.settings_applied</command>, which signifies the
completion of the toggle operation to the <link
linkend="contentpolicy">content policy</link>.

browser properties.</para>
 <sect2>
  <title>Test Settings</title>
  <para>
This button under the Proxy Settings tab provides a way to verify that the 
proxy settings are correct, and actually do route through the Tor network. It
performs this check by issuing an <ulink
url="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/XMLHttpRequest">XMLHTTPRequest</ulink>
for <ulink
url="https://check.torproject.org/?TorButton=True">https://check.torproject.org/?Torbutton=True</ulink>.
This is a special page that returns very simple, yet well-formed XHTML that
Torbutton can easily inspect for a hidden link with an id of
<command>TorCheckResult</command> and a target of <command>success</command>
or <command>failure</command> to indicate if the
user hit the page from a Tor IP, a non-Tor IP. This check is handled in
<function>torbutton_test_settings()</function> in <ulink
url="https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/torbutton/trunk/src/chrome/content/torbutton.js">torbutton.js</ulink>.
Presenting the results to the user is handled by the <ulink
url="https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/torbutton/trunk/src/chrome/content/preferences.xul">preferences
window</ulink>
callback <function>torbutton_prefs_test_settings()</function> in <ulink

 <sect2 id="plugins">
  <title>Disable plugins on Tor Usage (crucial)</title>

 <para>Option: <command>extensions.torbutton.no_tor_plugins</command></para>

 <para>Enabling this preference causes the above mentioned Torbutton chrome web progress
 listener <command>torbutton_weblistener</command> to disable Java via <command>security.enable_java</command> and to disable
 plugins via the browser <ulink
 url="http://www.xulplanet.com/references/xpcomref/ifaces/nsIDocShell.html">docShell</ulink>
 attribute <command>allowPlugins</command>. These flags are set every time a new window is
 created (<function>torbutton_tag_new_browser()</function>), every time a web
load
event occurs
 (<function>torbutton_update_tags()</function>), and every time the tor state is changed
 (<function>torbutton_update_status()</function>). As a backup measure, plugins are also
 prevented from loading by the content policy in <ulink
url="https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/torbutton/trunk/src/components/cssblocker.js">@torproject.org/cssblocker;1</ulink> if Tor is
 enabled and this option is set.
 </para> 
 
 <para>Even all this turns out to be insufficient if the user directly
 clicks on a plugin-handled mime-type. <ulink
url="http://www.janusvm.com/goldy/pdf/">In this case</ulink> (and also <ulink
url="http://www.janusvm.com/goldy/side-channels/frames/">this
one</ulink>), the browser decides that
 maybe it should ignore all these other settings and load the plugin anyways,
 because maybe the user really did want to load it (never mind this same
 load-style could happen automatically  with meta-refresh or any number of
 other ways..). To handle these cases, Torbutton stores a list of plugin-handled
 mime-types, and sets the pref
<command>plugin.disable_full_page_plugin_for_types</command> to this list.
Additionally, (since nothing can be assumed when relying on Firefox
preferences and internals) if it detects a load of one of them from the web progress
 listener, it cancels the request, tells the associated DOMWindow 
to stop loading, clears the document, AND throws an exception. Anything short 
of all this and
 the plugin managed to find some way to load.
 </para>
 
 <para>
 All this could be avoided, of course, if Firefox would either <ulink
url="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=401296">obey
 allowPlugins</ulink> for directly visited URLs, or notify its content policy for such
 loads either <ulink

 not very encouraging.

Since most plugins completely ignore browser proxy settings, the actions
performed by this setting are crucial to satisfying the <link

 <title>Isolate Dynamic Content to Tor State (crucial)</title>

 <para>Option: <command>extensions.torbutton.isolate_content</command></para>

<para>Enabling this preference is what enables the <ulink
url="https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/torbutton/trunk/src/components/cssblocker.js">@torproject.org/cssblocker;1</ulink> content policy
mentioned above, and causes it to block content load attempts in pages an
opposite Tor state from the current state. Freshly loaded <ulink
url="http://www.xulplanet.com/references/elemref/ref_tabbrowser.html">browser
tabs</ulink> are tagged 
with a <command>__tb_load_state</command> member in
<function>torbutton_update_tags()</function> and this
value is compared against the current tor state in the content policy.</para>

<para>It also kills all Javascript in each page loaded under that state by
toggling the <command>allowJavascript</command> <ulink
url="http://www.xulplanet.com/references/xpcomref/ifaces/nsIDocShell.html">docShell</ulink> property, and issues a
<ulink
url="http://www.xulplanet.com/references/xpcomref/ifaces/nsIWebNavigation.html#method_stop">webNavigation.stop(webNavigation.STOP_ALL)</ulink> to each browser tab (the
equivalent of hitting the STOP button).</para>

<para>

Unfortunately, <ulink
url="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=409737">Firefox bug
409737</ulink> prevents <command>docShell.allowJavascript</command> from killing
all event handlers, and event handlers registered with <ulink
url="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/DOM:element.addEventListener">addEventListener()</ulink>
are still able to execute. The <link linkend="contentpolicy">Torbutton Content
Policy</link> should prevent such code from performing network activity within
the current tab, but activity that happens via a popup window or via a
Javascript redirect can still slip by. For this reason, Torbutton blocks
popups by checking for a valid <ulink
url="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/DOM:window.opener">window.opener</ulink>
attribute in <function>torbutton_check_progress()</function>. If the window
has an opener from a different Tor state, its load is blocked. The content
policy also takes similar action to prevent Javascript redirects. This also
has the side effect/feature of preventing the user from following any links
from a page loaded in an opposite Tor state.

<title>Hook Dangerous Javascript (crucial)</title>

<para>This setting enables injection of the <ulink

pages to hook the <ulink url="http://phrogz.net/objJob/object.asp?id=224">Date

<function>torbutton_hookdoc()</function>, which is called ultimately by both the 
<ulink

and <ulink

to mask window size information and user agent properties not handled by the
standard Firefox user agent override settings. The resolution hooks
effectively make the Firefox browser window appear to websites as if the renderable area
takes up the entire desktop, has no toolbar or other GUI element space, and
the desktop itself has no toolbars.
These hooks drastically reduce the amount of information available to do <link

<title>Resize windows to multiples of 50px during Tor usage (recommended)</title>

 <para>Option: <command>extensions.torbutton.resize_windows</command></para>

<para>

This option drastically cuts down on the number of distinct anonymity sets
that divide the Tor web userbase. Without this setting, the dimensions for a
typical browser window range from 600-1200 horizontal pixels and 400-1000
vertical pixels, or about 600x600 = 360000 different sets. Resizing the
browser window to multiples of 50 on each side reduces the number of sets by
50^2, bringing the total number of sets to 144. Of course, the distribution
among these sets are not uniform, but scaling by 50 will improve the situation
due to this non-uniformity for users in the less common resolutions.
Obviously the ideal situation would be to lie entirely about the browser
window size, but this will likely cause all sorts of rendering issues, and is
also not implementable in a foolproof way from extension land.

</para>
<para>

The implementation of this setting is spread across a couple of different
locations in the Torbutton javascript <link linkend="browseroverlay">browser
overlay</link>. Since resizing minimized windows causes them to be restored,
and since maximized windows remember their previous size to the pixel, windows
must be resized before every document load (at the time of browser tagging)
via <function>torbutton_check_round()</function>, called by
<function>torbutton_update_tags()</function>. To prevent drift, the extension
tracks the original values of the windows and uses this to perform the
rounding on document load. In addition, to prevent the user from resizing a
window to a non-50px multiple, a resize listener
(<function>torbutton_do_resize()</function>) is installed on every new browser
window to record the new size and round it to a 50px multiple while Tor is
enabled. In all cases, the browser's contentWindow.innerWidth and innerHeight
are set. This ensures that there is no discrepancy between the 50 pixel cutoff
and the actual renderable area of the browser (so that it is not possible to
infer toolbar size/presence by the distance to the nearest 50 pixel roundoff).

arbitrary files from the local filesystem</ulink> to arbitrary websites. To
make matters worse, the 'Content-Disposition' header can be injected

activity via the content policy, but until that bug is fixed, there is some
risk that there are alternate ways to bypass the policy. This option is
available as an extra assurance of <link linkend="isolation">Network
Isolation</link> for those who would like to be sure that when Tor is toggled
all page activity has ceased. It also serves as a potential future workaround
in the event a content policy failure is discovered, and provides an additional

The nsIShistoryListener is instantiated with a reference to the containing

This is marked as a crucial setting in part
because Javascript access to the history object is indistinguishable from 
user clicks, and because
<ulink

can issue reloads after Tor toggle to reveal your original IP. Even without

Torbutton has to work around a number of Firefox bugs that impact its
security. Most of these are mentioned elsewhere in this document, but they
have also been gathered here for reference. Several of these have fixes in
Firefox3.0/trunk, but are listed because they still have not been backported
to FF2.0. In order of decreasing severity, they are:

The lack of a config or API to configure the timezone requires Torbutton to
<link linkend="jshooks">insert client content window javascript</link> to hook
the Date object. Additionally, a way to <ulink
url="http://pseudo-flaw.net/tor/torbutton/unmask-date.html">remove the Date

javascript sandboxing prevents most of the javascript hooks from being
installed, including the Date hooks. On Windows and Linux, you can set the TZ
environment variable to "UTC" as a workaround. Firefox will obey this
environment variable for your Timezone on those platforms, but on Windows this
does not take effect until browser restart.

The RSS Feed based "Livemarks"/"Live Bookmarks" update frequency is controlled
by the pref <command>browser.bookmarks.livemark_refresh_seconds</command>.
However, changing this preference does not cancel any pending timers, which
means that at least one livemarks pref fetch will happen over Tor, and once
this pref is set to disable livemarks for Tor, changing it back will never
cause the service to start back up again.

nsNSSCertificateDB::DeleteCertificate has race conditions</ulink>
      <para>

In Torbutton 1.2.0rc1, code was added to attempt to isolate SSL certificates
the user has installed. Unfortunately, the method call to delete a certificate
from the current certificate database acts lazily: it only sets a variable
that marks a cert for deletion later, and it is not cleared if that
certificate is re-added. This means that if the Tor state is toggled quickly,
that certificate could remain present until it is re-inserted (causing an
error dialog), and worse, it would still be deleted after that.  The lack of
this functionality is considered a Torbutton security bug because cert
isolation is considered a <link linkend="state">State Separation</link>
feature.

This bug allows pages to execute javascript via addEventListener and perhaps
other callbacks. In order to prevent this bug from enabling an attacker to
break the <link linkend="isolation">Network Isolation</link> requirement,
Torbutton 1.1.13 began blocking popups and history manipulation from different
Tor states.  So long as there are no ways to open popups or redirect the user
to a new page, the <link linkend="contentpolicy">Torbutton content
policy</link> should block Javascript network access. However, if there are
ways to open popups or perform redirects such that Torbutton cannot block
them, pages may still have free reign to break that requirement and reveal a
user's original IP address.

In Firefox 3, the change to the new sqlite database for cookie storage has a
bug that prevents Torbutton's cookie jaring from working properly. The
"profile-do-change" observer event no longer properly causes either a sync or
reload of the cookie database from disk after it is copied into place.
Torbutton currently works around this by issuing the SQLLite queries manually
to store and rebuild the cookie database.

It is difficult to determine which tabbrowser many XPCOM callbacks originate
from, and in some cases absolutely no context information is provided at all.
While this doesn't have much of an effect on Torbutton, it does make writing

Under Firefox 3, the XPCSafeJSObjectWrapper breaks when you try to use
constructors of classes defined from within the scope of the sandbox, among
other things. This prevents Torbutton from applying the Timezone hooks under
Firefox 3, but a better solution for Torbutton's specific date hooking needs 
would be a fix for the above mentioned Bug 392274. Of course, many more

nsIContentPolicy::shouldLoad no longer called for favicons</ulink>
    <para>

Firefox 3.0 stopped calling the shouldLoad call of content policy for favicon
loads. Torbutton had relied on this call to block favicon loads for opposite
Tor states. The workaround it employs for Firefox 3 is to cancel the request
when it arrives in the <command>torbutton_http_observer</command> used for
blocking full page plugin loads. This seems to work just fine, but is a bit

This is a call that would be useful to develop a better workaround for the

handed over to a plugin or helper app, it would make the workaround for the
above allowPlugins bug a lot cleaner. Obviously this bug is not as severe as
the others though, but it might be nice to have this API as a backup.

     <para>

Similar to the javascript plugin disabling attribute, the plugin disabling
attribute is also not perfect &mdash; it is ignored for direct links to plugin
handled content, as well as meta-refreshes to plugin handled content.  This
requires Torbutton to listen to a number of different http events to intercept
plugin-related mime type URLs and cancel their requests. Again, since plugins
are quite horrible about obeying proxy settings, loading a plugin pretty much
ensures a way to break the <link linkend="isolation">Network Isolation</link>
requirement and reveal a user's original IP address. Torbutton's code to
perform this workaround has been subverted at least once already by Kyle
Williams.

url="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=419598">Bug 419598 - 'var
Date' is deletable</ulink>
     <para>

Based on Page 62 of the <ulink
url="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/Ecma-262.pdf">ECMA-262
Javascript spec</ulink>, it seems like it should be possible to do something
like the following to prevent the Date object from being unmasked:
<screen>
with(window) {
    var Date = fakeDate;
    var otherVariable = 42;
}

delete window.Date; // Should fail. Instead succeeds, revealing original Date.
delete window.otherVariable; // Fails, leaving window.otherVariable set to 42.
</screen>

From the ECMA-262 spec:

<blockquote>
If the variable statement occurs inside a FunctionDeclaration, the variables
are defined with function-local scope in that function, as described in
s10.1.3. Otherwise, they are defined with global scope (that is, they are
created as members of the global object, as described in 10.1.3) using
property attributes { DontDelete }. Variables are created when the execution
scope is entered. A Block does not define a new execution scope. Only Program
and FunctionDeclaration produce a new scope. Variables are initialized to
undefined when created. A variable with an Initialiser is assigned the value
of its AssignmentExpression when the VariableStatement is executed, not when
the variable is created.
</blockquote>

In fact, this is exactly how the with statement with a variable declaration
behaves <emphasis>for all other variables other than ones that shadow system
variables</emphasis>. Some variables (such as
<command>window.screen</command>, and <command>window.history</command>) can't
even be shadowed in this way, and give an error about lacking a setter. If
such shadowing were possible, it would greatly simplify the Javascript hooking
code, which currently relies on undocumented semantics of
<command>__proto__</command> to copy the original values in the event of a
delete. This <command>__proto__</command> hack unfortunately does not work for
the Date object though.

  <title>Testing</title>
  <para>

The purpose of this section is to cover all the known ways that Tor browser
security can be subverted from a testing and penetration perspective. The hope
is that it will be useful both for creating a &quot;Tor Safety Check&quot;
page, and for developing novel tests and actively attacking Torbutton with the
goal of finding vulnerabilities in either it or the Mozilla components,
interfaces and settings upon which it relies.

   <title>Single state testing</title>
   <para>
The following tests can be run from a single web page in one visit without
toggling Tor state or requiring user interaction. Currently they exist as their
own individual tests, but conceivably a single &quot;Tor Safety Check&quot;
page can be devised that contains all of these attacks. 
All of these tests are currently known to pass, but that does not mean that
consolidating them into an easy to run test page is pointless. Torbutton is a
complicated piece of software. During development, changes to one component
can affect a whole slough of unrelated features. Having easy-to-verify
comprehensive test pages would make it much easier to fix other issues as they
present themselves without introducing regressions.

some form of network capability, and every one ignores proxy settings or worse - only
partially obeys them. This includes but is not limited to:
QuickTime, Windows Media Player, RealPlayer, mplayerplug-in, AcroRead, and

the cache to <ulink

   <title>Active testing (aka How to Hack Torbutton)</title>

The idea behind active testing is to discover vulnerabilities in Torbutton to

identifiers, leak location information, or otherwise violate <link
linkend="requirements">its requirements</link>. Torbutton has ventured out
into a strange and new security landscape. It depends on Firefox mechanisms
that haven't necessarily been audited for security, certainly not for the
threat model that Torbutton seeks to address. As such, it and the interfaces
it depends upon still need a 'trial by fire' typical of new technologies. This
section of the document was written with the intention of making that period
as fast as possible. Please help us get through this period by considering
these attacks, playing with them, and reporting what you find (and potentially
submitting the test cases back to be run in the standard batch of Torbutton
tests.

to have another set of eyes try it out.</listitem>
     <listitem>Similarly, is there any way to confuse the <link

mentioned above to cause it to allow certain types of page fetches? For
example, it was recently discovered that favicons are not fetched by the

correct window to determine the current Tor tag for the favicon fetch. Are
there other things that can do this? Popups? Bookmarklets? Active bookmarks? </listitem>
     <listitem>Alternate ways to store and fetch unique identifiers. For example, <ulink

     <listitem>Chrome-escalation attacks. The interaction between the
